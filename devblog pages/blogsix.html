          Experience continuing the development of my website: This week, I
          finally figured out how to make the images in my portfolio section
          clickable, it took a couple of trial-and-error runs, but I managed to
          get there in the end, and I am excited to see it work! Another thing I
          also loved to see work was my hover feature on my home page so that
          when people hover over the various page name a little grey line
          expands beneath it and the user can know which page they will be
          selecting on and that it is clickable.

          Reflection on this week’s work: This week we explored JS (also known
          as Java Script) from this I learnt that we make use of arrays in JS to
          generate information/stuff that one will make use of in your
          day-to-day. JS is a scripting language that allows one to create
          dynamically updating content, animate images, etc. (MozDevNet) When we
          come to the theory section for this week, we explored the topic of
          interaction design which refers to the UI (user interface), UX (user
          experience) and IA (information architecture). From the slides along
          with the lecture video what I can say that stood out to me is how UI
          and UX connect, and how to have a great website both of those elements
          need to be developed great, as one can be great however if the other
          is not it makes the overall website horrible. The second thing that
          stood out to me was responsive design being that the way information
          is displayed on the computer should be displayed on the phone, however
          in a manner that is easy to read and access, that does not confuse the
          viewer, along with is the webpage able to be viewed on various devices
          without it looking weird.

          Reflection on the reading: When we look at the reading by Hassenzahl,
          he touches on what is meant by UX (being user experience) and how we
          think it can look in the future. Within this reading, we can see that
          it emphasises the importance of user experience design within
          technology as their experience goes beyond mere experiences. Therefore
          highlighting how important it is for us to research so that we may
          better our understanding and enhancement user experience. Another
          thing that the reading touched on that stood out to me was how the
          need for research is crucial especially since we live in an age
          wherein technology is emerging, and we need to adapt our user
          experience to suit the needs of the user. To conclude the reading
          highlights the significance of user experience research and proposes a
          research agenda that considers the multifaceted nature of user
          experiences, the need for a holistic approach, longitudinal studies,
          and expanding research methods.

          Reflection on the exercises: When looking at this week's exercises,
          were Side Bar and Menu. For the Side Bar exercise we needed to add the
          functionality that allows the sidebar of the website to hide/show
          itself upon clicking the burger icon and close the sidebar when
          clicking on the "X" icon. When it came to doing this exercise,
          unfortunately, the code did not work even when I tried the answers
          provided to us, it still did not want to work, however, I plan on
          bringing this query up and hopefully, I can fix any mistakes on my
          side or anything I missed so that this does not happen to me when I
          need to use JS for my main website. The next exercise was the Menu
          exercises, which was okay to understand, there were of course some
          mistakes and errors I made as I am new to the content and learning
          what needs to be done, but with the use of the memo, I was able to see
          where I went wrong and what I should’ve done instead. Overall I feel
          that I just need to practice more then I will be able to understand
          the work much better, for if I do not practice, I will not know what
          it is exactly I am supposed to do.
