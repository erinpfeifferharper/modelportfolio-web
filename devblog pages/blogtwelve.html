          Start investigating APIs: When looking at what an API is, this stands
          for Application Programming Interface which is a set of rules that
          allows various software applications to communicate along with
          interacting with each other. They operate as intermediates, allowing
          various software components to interact without needing to understand
          each other's fundamental details or implementation. They let
          developers to make requests, exchange data, and get replies from other
          applications or services in a standardized manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          What kind of API do you feel would add value to your website: Seeing
          that we are living in the digital age, and everything is accessed on
          the website I think it would be cool for me to add a translation API
          as it will be able to translate the text on my website, even though it
          is not much to various people across the world, as not everyone can
          understand or speak English. This would be great to draw attention to
          my website from all over the world along with being inclusive of those
          who are not native English speakers.
        </p>
        <p>
          What are the technical challenges you foresee: I feel like not being
          able to construct the layout of how I want it to look, have accurate
          translations of these various languages google translates the
          incorrect information at times and I do not know of a lot of people
          that speak these various languages fluently that will be able to
          ensure that the spelling and construction of sentences in these
          languages are correct. Write a reflection on "Traveling While Trans"
          from Costanza-Chock, S. (2020) Design Justice: Community-Led Practices
          to Build the Worlds We Need. Cambridge, MA, USA: MIT Press
          (Information Policy) In the reading by Constanza-Chock, this reading
          can be seen to highlight multiple issues that are faced by
          marginalised groups and some ways in which we can solve these issues.
          To dive further into it, the reading underlines the necessity of
          include disadvantaged people' perspectives and demands in design
          processes. It demonstrates how cisgender norms and assumptions
          frequently affect public space design, resulting in an exclusionary
          and unfriendly atmosphere for transgender and gender nonconforming
          people. This raises fundamental considerations regarding designers'
          and society's responsibilities to actively confront and deconstruct
          these standards to build more inclusive places. Another important
          component of the article is the study of technology's function in both
          sustaining and altering current power structures. While technology can
          empower and link communities, it also has the potential to be used to
          monitor, control, and discriminate against underprivileged groups.
          This underlines the critical need for ethical and inclusive design
          methods that promote transgender persons' autonomy and well-being, as
          well as their safety and privacy.
