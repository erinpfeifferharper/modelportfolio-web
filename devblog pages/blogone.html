          GitHub: I am familiar with GitHub as I already had it set up last year
          when working on a game design group project, it was complicated at
          first especially when setting it up, but I eventually got the hang of
          it and now I understand it as well as how it works.

          Reflection on Readings: ‘The Library of Babel’ was quite confusing at
          first I had to read it a couple of times before I understood what was
          being said as well as conduct some research, while doing my research I
          looked at images of the library of babel and that helped me understand
          what was being spoken about in the reading. Another thing I saw while
          doing my research was a website created by Jonathan Basile based on
          this written piece by Borges and I found to be very interesting to see
          this adaptation of these multiple books found in these hexagonal
          libraries, how the website was set up and how when interacting with
          the home page you can see how it moves through different word
          combinations per letter, which we know from Borges reading that the
          books are unique and they differ by a single letter/punctuation, which
          we see in the website. Something I found interesting was that so much
          information can be found on both the website as well as these books in
          the library for cures, futuristic technology etc. however chances of
          finding the information in the books are very low as you would need to
          know what you are looking for and understand it.

          Goals for this course: My goal for this course is to develop an
          understanding of the different coding languages and know how to use
          these languages when creating websites. I am really excited to create
          websites and to know more about what makes a website successful and
          implement that into my designs.
