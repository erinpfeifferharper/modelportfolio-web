          Continuation of the development of my website What changes have you
          had to make to your website to incorporate JavaScript: When it comes
          to the changes, I have incorporated into my website to make sure it
          displays some form of Java Script. I have focused on brainstorming
          some ideas, as I want my website to be as minimal as possible, finding
          what kind of animations/movements I want to incorporate has been quite
          tricky. I have looked at some ideas and these are what stood out to me
          and what I would want to try and incorporate into my website: <br />
          I’m not too sure on the correct name for this item, but basically as
          you hover your mouse over certain images it appears with a certain
          text relating to it – whether it needs to open it or close it etc.
          <br />Having something interactable/moving on my home page. <br />When
          I hover over the images the move.

          Reflect on Readings: The reading I have selected and gone through is
          titled ‘The Road to Technocolonialism’ by Giorgos Verdi.
          Technocolonialism refers to the influence and dominance that is
          exerted by technological powers over less developed regions. With this
          definition in mind we can see this kind of power being exerted by
          China and the United States to other countries across the world as
          their ‘success is largely due to their “domestic champions”, the
          multinational corporations that have come to be known as GAFAMI
          (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM) and BATX (Baidu,
          Alibaba, Tencent, Xiaomi) $3.3 trillion of market capitalization.’ The
          concept of techno-colonialism is introduced in the article, in which
          centralized control and ownership of technology are utilized to impose
          dominance. AI superpowers are expected to exercise influence on client
          governments, extending their political and economic might while
          getting access to vital data. This therefore highlights that the rise
          of AI will profoundly impact geopolitics in the 21st century. If
          uncontrolled, poor countries may be forced to choose between adopting
          techno-colonialism and entering a new dark era.
