          Continuing the Development of my website: With the technical lecture
          being a continuation of CSS it has shown me a new way of organising
          information by using flexboxes, although I know I used it in my code,
          this video showed me different ways of using it along with providing a
          much better understanding of it than I had before. I plan to use what
          I have learnt within these technical lectures into my third assignment
          and better wherever I went wrong in my first assignment.

          Close Reading: For the reading I looked at “Making A Feminist Internet
          In Africa: Why The Internet Needs African Feminists And Feminisms” by
          Sheena Magenya along with the theory content provided as I felt they
          both linked so well to one another. When we look at the reading Sheena
          focuses on the intersection of gender, technology, and culture in
          Africa, as well as how a feminist approach to the internet can promote
          social justice and gender equality. Sheena then goes on to argue that
          the internet can promote these norms mentioned before however it is
          still dominated by the patriarchal norms and structures. The author
          discusses how gender-based violence, such as online harassment and
          cyberstalking, is prevalent on the internet in Africa, and how this
          can chill women's participation and freedom of expression online,
          which links back to the idea of the internet being dominated by the
          patriarchal structure. Furthermore, the article delves into various
          African initiatives and organizations working toward a feminist
          internet. It addresses the importance of digital rights advocacy,
          capacity building, and collaboration among activists, researchers, and
          policymakers in creating a more feminist and inclusive digital
          environment.
