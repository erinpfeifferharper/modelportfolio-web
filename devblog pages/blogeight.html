          Reflection on Assignment 1 Website: When it comes to my website, I
          will be reflecting on it by answering the following questions below.
          What went wrong? When I look at what went wrong within my website it
          would have to be the portfolio sidebar menu, for when this menu pops
          up it appears behind the portfolio images instead of in front of the
          images, as on the other page it appears in front of any information.
          What went right? In my website, I loved how my minimal theme came to
          life, I loved that my image links worked, my hover animations and the
          fonts I imported worked. Where did I struggle? When I look at the
          areas I struggled with, some I managed to figure out along the way
          whilst others I unfortunately did not however, I know that I tried and
          that these things I can work on when it comes to the next assignment.
          Areas that I struggled with, wherein I was able to eventually solve
          were the following: <br />
          Adding links to my portfolio images <br />
          Allowing my icons on my contact page to display <br />
          Placing my images in a specific order that had the same width and
          height box shape. <br />Having my surname displayed on my homepage
          within the middle of the page. Areas I struggled with that I was
          unable to fix were the following: <br />
          Portfolio sidebar displaying behind image. <br />
          Implementing certain CSS elements. <br />
          Trying to centre the contact form submit button and the information
          displayed on it.<br />
          What would I do differently? When it comes to what I would do
          differently in my next website is trying to add a colour scheme,
          changing the way my dev blog section has been structured, try and
          create more sections within the navigation bar, a scroll to top
          button, changing the from page font and layout. These are just some of
          the stuffs I can think about changing off the top of my head. Overall
          I really enjoyed creating my website, I feel I could’ve done better in
          certain areas, but I was happy with my first result.

          Reflection on the Readings: Looking at the reading for this week the
          first reading I will be discussing is the reading touching on the
          ‘study of information geographies:(im) mutable augmentations and a
          mapping of the geographies of information’ by Graham, Sabbata and
          Zook. In this reading what I would say stood out to me was the opening
          line of the reading that states “Information has always had geography.
          It is from somewhere; about somewhere; it evolves and is transformed
          somewhere; it is mediated by networks, infrastructures, and
          technologies: all of which exist in physical, material places.”However
          with that in mind the authors thus examine how information is not
          evenly distributed globally and how certain factors such as
          socioeconomic conditions, power, regulation, and infrastructure shape
          the geographies of information. Looking at the second reading by
          Ballatore, Graham and Sen touching on the topic of ‘ Digital
          Hegemonies: The Localness of Search Engine Results’ discusses how the
          information the user is shown/exposed to depends upon their
          geographical location. With that in mind when this research was
          conducted it also portrays how countries that are wealthy and well
          connected tend to have more locally produced content visible about
          them than countries that are poor or poorly connected.
        </p>
        <p>
          How the two readings relate and impact my thinking about web dev as a
          South African: When reading along with analysing the readings above,
          they are very insightful as it makes you more aware of the challenges
          faced by users in terms of accessing and discovering information
          online. Overall from these readings we can see how it brings about
          awareness in terms of the complexities surrounding information
          geographies, digital platforms, and the localness of online content.
