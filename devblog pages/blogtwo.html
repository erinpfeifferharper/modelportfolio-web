          Experience with starting html: Starting HTML has been a very exciting
          experience for me, the lecture videos have been so informative as to
          the steps we need to take when creating a website. I enjoyed playing
          around with it by adding the various texts and linking various pages
          you would find on the web to each other such as the home page to the
          about page. It has been amazing to see what goes into making a website
          along with doing it myself.

          Reading reflections: Why Should You Use HTML5 was one of the readings
          that dealt with why one should utilise certain divisions such as
          article and section along with explaining what each of them are and
          how one can use them to make your website more user friendly. How A
          Screen Reader User Accesses the Web: A Smashing Video touches on how
          when we create websites we need to keep in mind the users that are
          unable to read, see, etc. as it will make the information on the web
          easier to navigate through and grasp. Another thing that stood out was
          when the various sites were being portrayed in the video one of the
          websites code contents was not hidden properly therefore the screen
          reader picks up those and reads it to the user when it is not relevant
          to the page the user is on.

          Reflection on Internet histories: When watching the lecture on
          internet histories as well as looking at the timeline of the internet,
          I found it quite amazing to look back at where the internet all
          started and how it has grown over time along with looking at the ideas
          put into creating these various websites/applications/devices.
