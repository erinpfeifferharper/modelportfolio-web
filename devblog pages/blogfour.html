          Experience continuing the development of my website: This week I
          played around with some of the CSS coding parts of my website to kind
          of get a feel as to how I want to style it in terms of the colours,
          fonts, etc. I found myself looking at various fonts and font ideas on
          Pinterest as I want the font of my website to be very minimal but also
          very pretty. I have also examined the previous wireframe layout of my
          website and I felt that some of the designs were a bit too much to do
          as a beginner in creating a website so I went back to my drawing board
          and a made a few changes which I am very happy about ( I also included
          a variety depending on what page I plan in creating so that I can try
          out the various looks on my website)
        </p>
        <p>
          How my wireframes hold up against the readings and lectures on UI:
          When it comes to my wireframes, I feel they hold up to the readings
          along with the lectures on UI as it has been made simple and
          understandable for the user to engage with it instead of trying to
          figure out how my UI works within the game. In the reading, it states
          that having ‘great UI allows people to engage with the product without
          friction, not spending time trying to figure it out’ (UIPin 2020)
          Another thing that I learnt from the reading that stood out is when
          designing the website it needs to be accessible for those who are
          visually impaired such as people with colour blindness or people who a
          blind. This stood out to me for when I watched last week’s YouTube
          video by Smashing Magazine wherein a blind screen reader user accesses
          various websites to see if they are good or not, there were a few in
          which the code that is supposed to appear as inviable to the user as
          it however when the website reader goes through it, it picks up some
          of these things that we who can see would not pick up for we do not
          normally use the screen reader. This is something I hope to try and
          incorporate in the wireframes and design of my website, as a website
          should be easy to access for all.

          How does UI relate to interactivity: When we look at what UI and
          interactivity are they are defined as follows: UI is the graphical
          representation of a program or system that allows users to interact
          with it and Interactivity is how the user can interact with the UI and
          the system that it represents and to what degree. Therefore, a
          well-designed UI should be easy and fast, allowing users a full
          understanding of the features provided along with how to interact with
          them. The level of interactivity in the UI could have a major
          influence on the user experience, influencing how engaging and
          satisfying the interaction is for the user. An example of this is
          clear and easy-to-use navigation menus, clickable buttons, sliders,
          dropdown menus etc. which can help users to engage more actively with
          the website and achieve their outcomes more efficiently.
        </p>

          Reflection on this week’s readings: I feel that the reading ‘The Basic
          Principles of UI Design’ is something to always refer back to as web
          designers for a good UI are crucial to having a great user experience
          and as web developers that is what we want, we do not want the user to
          be unable to use our website – as if that is the case our website will
          not be used for it has bad UI. The reading touched on some of the
          basics that we need to try to implement into our UI Design which I
          found to be very useful and allowed me to think about how I want to
          make my website a better design, not just for me but for the users.
