          Continue writing about your development process. Keep thinking about
          your use of APIs and how you would implement one: When continuing the
          development of my website, I have not found any other APIs that stood
          out to me in which I can incorporate into my website. However I am
          still thinking about the translation API.

          Write a reflection on at least two of the readings in Research:
          Internet, Society and Design Justice: The first reading we will be
          looking at is ‘Design Justice’ by Constanza-Chock which provides an
          engaging viewpoint on the convergence of design, technology, and
          social justice. The reading emphasizes the need of include
          underrepresented people in design processes and questioning
          established power dynamics. The importance of participatory and
          community-led design processes that highlight the perspectives and
          needs of people directly touched by design decisions is emphasized.
          The talk on the politics of design and how design decisions may
          perpetuate, or challenge existing injustices struck a chord with me.
          The reader urges that us as designers critically evaluate our own
          prejudices and preconceptions to create more fair and inclusive design
          solutions. The urge to recognize and dismantle oppressive structures
          within design methods serves as a reminder of the ethical obligations
          that come with being a designer. The second reading I will be looking
          at is ‘Computer Science Communities: Who is Speaking, and Who is
          listening to the Women’ can be seen to be about how Women's
          underrepresentation in computer science has been a long-standing
          concern. The reading delves into the dynamics of women's engagement in
          computer science groups, stressing the voices that are present as well
          as the difficulties they experience in being heard. Women have
          historically been neglected and faced many challenges in computer
          science. Implicit biases, prejudices, gender discrimination, and a
          lack of representation and support networks are among the challenges.
          These variables can contribute to feelings of isolation, impostor
          syndrome, and restricted job progression chances. It is critical to
          acknowledge that diversity and inclusion in computer science groups
          are not only necessary for fairness and social justice, but also for
          the field's growth.
