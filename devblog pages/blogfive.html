          Experience continuing the development of my website: This week, I
          managed to gather all the images needed for my website along with
          making final cuts on the images that I would like to implement into my
          website. Final cuts were also made on where certain elements needed to
          be, such as discarding my portfolio section that had a mini section
          titled runway due to not having enough information – being images – to
          put in that specific section. Thereafter I finally managed to
          implement a menu button for when you enter my various pages from my
          home page so that you can go back, there are a few errors such as
          certain works not showing and the bar hiding under some text and
          images – seen in the portfolio section of my website, however, I plan
          to fix this in the weeks to come.

          Reflection on this week’s work: Within this week there were no
          readings, hence no readings to reflect upon, however, I will be
          reflecting on the technical work done within this week and how I found
          it to be. This week we looked at DOM, which means document object
          model. This refers to a programming API for documents wherein it
          defines the logical structure of documents and how the document can be
          accessed along with being manipulated.

          Reflection on the exercises: When it came to the exercises we had to
          do for this week, they were the Color Chnager Exercise Setup, Counter
          and Reviews. The Color Changer exercise, I found to be quite difficult
          from the start as I tried to do the exercise in the same way we had
          done the technical exercises from the videos which resulted in me
          creating a whole new JavaScript file when I did not need to, instead,
          I needed to use the file provided and implement the code there. Hence
          why when I would engage with the webpage the functions did not work.
          In the Counter exercise, based on the work done in the previous
          exercise, I was able to see that one needs to make use of the
          JavaScript file provided which is ‘app.js’ with that in mind and I
          found this exercise to be much easier than the previous one. The
          Reviews exercise reminded me of the Quote exercise we did within the
          tutorial, this helped in terms of placing the quotes of the people
          while using the button the generate a random with surprised me. What I
          would say I found to be quite tricky about this exercise were the
          images.
