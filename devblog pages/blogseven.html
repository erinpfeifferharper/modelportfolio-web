          My experience in developing my website: As it is the second last week
          before our website is due, I have managed to get where I needed to be.
          It has shown me that when I look back on my initial wireframes, how a
          lot of what I wanted to do needed to go as it was not working out and
          some of it did not fit my aesthetic. Along the way, I also encountered
          some problems such as some of my icons not showing and my menu bar not
          working, however in this week and the weeks to come I plan to try and
          fix all of this before the submission of my website.

          Reflection on Lecture by Peta Goldberg: From this lecture video what I
          can say that stood out to me was the various ethical concerns that
          come when designing a website along with the three types of UX ethics
          we find. When it comes to ethical concerns, the influence of user
          behaviour stood out the most as we as the designers of these websites
          nudge the user, and what is meant by this is that we instigate a
          system wherein we want to user to engage with the product in a certain
          way which will lead them to behave in that way. Linking to the idea of
          how we place certain interactable objects – i.e., buttons on the
          screen such as in games if you want the user to click a certain button
          you would normally place it on the right side instead of on the left
          side. And lastly, when you implement UX within your website there are
          three factors and they are ‘why’, ‘what’ and ‘how’. With these three
          factors, it is important to note that changing any of them impacts
          everything else, so one needs to be aware of the changes to establish
          a balance within the design.

          IxD Process Mashup Lecture: When looking at the IxD design process
          when I look at what I have done so far and what I have not they can be
          seen as follows, I have worked on what is known as my goal alignment
          for the website and I am still currently working on the other factors
          within my IxD document.

          Reflection on Reading: When we look at the article on ‘User Experience
          – A Research Agenda’ by Hassenzahl and Tractinsky dives into the
          concept of user experience and discusses a better method when trying
          to understand and define the user experience. One of the writers' main
          issues is the requirement for a precise definition of UX. They contend
          that, while user experience (UX) is a frequently used term in the
          field of human-computer interaction (HCI) and design, there is still
          no agreement on its meaning. With this, the reading shows us why there
          is a need for us to explore the various dimension of user experience.
          Overall, the essay gives useful insights into the idea of user
          experience and recommends a study agenda to expand our understanding
          of this topic. It highlights the need of having a clear concept of UX,
          explore multiple elements of UX, take context into account, and use
          qualitative approaches in UX research.
