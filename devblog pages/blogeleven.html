          How your CSS relates to the HTML and JS: When it comes to the CSS in
          relation to the HTML part within my website it is clear to see that
          this coding language styles my website, to be more specific, when
          looking at my portfolio section, it places the images accordingly
          without it being on one side of my webpage. And how the CSS relates to
          my JS of my webpage is seen in the following ways. Initially I had
          placed an image on my website homepage to add some JS to my website, I
          loved the outcome of this however when I added my next element which
          was moving text, it made the website look and feel overwhelming hence
          why I decided to stick to the text as I want to bring across the idea
          of a minimal website.

          The benefits and challenges of responsive design: When we look at
          responsive design and the benefits that come with it while looking at
          my website they can be seen as having a great responsive design which
          allows the website to be accessed on any device without the screen on
          the various devices looking weird. And what I would say is a challenge
          when creating a responsive designed website is making sure the
          websites content is also responsive and changing the image sizes so
          that it does not load as long.
