          With the digital age becoming more predominant in our society, the use
          of websites for various services has increased. Some of these services
          include displaying the latest news, online shopping, social
          networking, etc. The website that I will be touching on in the essay
          is one of the South African based websites that provides us with the
          latest news and that is the ‘Daily Sun’(MEDIA24 2002). In this essay,
          we will be looking at how this website showcases user interface (UI)
          and user experience (UX) while drawing on the lectures and readings
          provided to me and some external sources as well. Furthermore, I will
          be looking at ethical implications based on the design of the website
          whilst highlighting any impacts it has on the user. <br />
          <br />
          Before we dive further into the just of our essay let us first look at
          what the ‘Daily Sun’ is. According to Media24 the ‘Daily Sun’ is one
          of the biggest daily newspapers in South Africa, that targets people
          who are readers in and around the urban centres within South Africa.
          (MEDIA24 n/d) With this being one of the biggest newspapers in South
          Africa that produce around 31000 papers a day they have decided to
          increase their digital space, as over 2 million people read the paper
          on social media networks such as Facebook within a month with the
          website receiving a million unique visitors a month. (Bosch &
          Wasserman, 2023) <br />
          <br />
          In an article by Glenda Nevill, editor-in-chief, Mapula Nkosi mentions
          how Daily Sun has worked on strengthening its digital offering by
          including content from all regions, whilst having an easy-to-navigate
          site that contains informative and entertaining news. (Nevill 2020)
          this can be seen to be a result of the national lockdown that took
          place in 2020, for with this online new publishers had reported an
          increased amount in their audience of 76% as everyone was indoors and
          to keep up with the latest news, they needed to utilise online sources
          as engaging with papers touched by other could ultimately spread covid
          hence why online was good as it benefitted many. <br />
          <br />
          Now with this background context established for our website that we
          will be discussing let’s talk about the user interface along with the
          user experience as mentioned above editor-in-chief mentioned how it is
          easy to navigate through, therefore implying that the website is
          user-friendly. <br />
          <br />
          When we look at the user interface (UI) this is how users interact
          with the website, computer, or application, wherein its goal is to
          make the experience of the user easy and intuitive, whereby it
          requires very minimal effort from the user to receive their outcome.
          (Indeed Editorial Team 2022) To begin our analysis of UI within the
          ‘Daily Sun’ website, we will be discussing a few core principles of UI
          and where they can be seen within the website. (MEDIA24 2002) Our
          first core principle we will look at is ‘clarity’. With this you need
          to establish whether your website is intuitive, simplified, and
          consistent. With ‘Daily Sun’ we can see the website showcases forms of
          simplification, intuitively, along with consistency as the user can
          move from one page to the next, there are appropriately labelled
          buttons that are there to direct the user and the elements displayed
          with on the website are clear and easy to understand. <br />
          <br />
          The next core principle we have is ‘familiarity’ which can be seen in
          the display of the navigation bar for users know this is what they
          need to click on to move to different pages, the search bar to search
          for any information the user needs and lastly the use of social media
          network icons that indicate to the user where they can also access the
          ‘Daily Sun’. When we get to the Users Control in the website, this is
          wherein the user must never feel like they are not in control or feel
          frustrated with the website as they do not know what is happening
          (Goldberg n/d) This can be seen as having a great portray on the
          website as when users navigate through it and they scroll down and
          click on a news article and would like to go back to where they were,
          they are not taken to the top of the page instead they are placed
          exactly where they were before, therefore allowing the user to be able
          to go back without refreshing the page and causing them to lose where
          they were previously on the page. <br />
          <br />
          Moving on we reach the hierarchy of UI principles which are
          information portrayed through visual design principles such as the
          page layout, colour, size, font, and negative space used. With this
          when it comes to the use of these elements, they are there to draw the
          viewer's eyes to the most important thing to the least. When we look
          at the ‘Daily Sun’ homepage our eyes are drawn to the words that are
          displayed in a different font, colour, and size such as the title of
          the page name, along with the title of the latest article on the page,
          thereafter your eyes will move towards the navigation bar and the rest
          of the information. The colour used on this page is red which stands
          out from the other colours used which are black, white and hints of
          yellow seen in the navigation bar and as a border for the most read
          articles. <br />
          <br />
          The next element we have is flexibility which conveys whether the
          website was designed in a responsive way wherein all users can use it
          from various devices such as computers, iPads, and phones. When it
          comes to this website however it is very responsive as the way you can
          view it on your computer and your phone provides a good experience to
          the user as they do not struggle navigating through it. However, when
          I tried to see if this site was responsive for iPads using ctrl +
          shift + ‘i’, the website was not as responsive as you would need to
          scroll left and right as well as up and down to access all the
          information portrayed, instead of moving up and down, which brought me
          to the question on if seeing whether a website is responsive or not
          while using that tool is reliable for on mobile it is responsive
          however on the website it shows that is not responsive for mobile
          devices. And having a responsive website is crucial as around 26
          million South Africans use a smartphone according to the statistics
          for the year 2023 (Taylor 2023) <br />
          <br />
          Moving on to the user experience within the website selected this is
          how the product being the website can provide meaningful and relevant
          experience to the users through the website. (What is user experience
          (UX) design? 2022) With this it is important to keep this design
          simple for it reduces the cognitive effort in which users need to
          engage in, as the interfaces are simple which results in less visual
          clutter, fewer elements being used and emphasising what is important
          to the user. (Georgieva 2022) <br />
          <br />
          Now when we look at the ‘Daily Sun’ website and its portrayal of user
          experience, it can be seen to be fairly positive due to the following:
          their navigation is straightforward as it allows the users easy access
          to the various sections portrayed on the website, along with this
          being portrayed at the top of the page allowing users to access
          information much easier than if it were portrayed at the bottom of the
          page. Moving on the design structure of the website is simple, which
          as mentioned previously the use of a simple website reduces cluttering
          and emphasises what is important to the user. The use of large images
          and bold headlines draws the viewer's eye to the focus points. With
          that in mind when they are portraying the latest news it is portrayed
          in a much bigger block than the rest, which allows it to draw your
          attention to it immediately before moving on and engaging with other
          news. With the above-mentioned this links to the serial position
          effect as it talks about how users can best remember the first and
          last item in a series of works. (Goldberg n/d) <br />
          <br />
          The website allows users to engage with the website, therefore,
          enhancing their user experience as users can leave comments beneath
          articles and engage with other readers through the comments. Overall,
          we can see that the website's user experience provides an
          easy-to-navigate through design for the users. <br />
          <br />
          To touch on the last thing that we will be discussing in the essay is
          the ethics behind the website and whether they portray good or bad
          ethics if interactive design, as with ethics it is about putting the
          needs of your users first even if your design is good or bad, however,
          do you meet the needs of your users. (Beasse & Wilansky, 2021) One of
          the important factors we will be diving into is if the website is
          accessible to those with disabilities, examples of those include,
          colour blindness, blindness, etc. <br />
          <br />
          With the ‘Daily Sun’ when it comes to identifying if this website is
          great for people with colour blindness the answer to that is yes,
          however, they can improve on their navigation bar as the colour is
          already grey when testing to see if it is colour blindness friendly
          the navigation bar is not as clear as before, hence why maybe a darker
          colour should be used to make this much easier to read.
          <br />
          <br />
          When it comes to the privacy concerns regarding the website, it is
          clear to see that ‘Daily Sun’ observes respect for its users as it
          contains a privacy policy that lets the users know how their personal
          information is processed and used. (Knoxville Daily Sun's Privacy
          Policy 2023) This is seen through the website's cookie policy as it
          informs users about cookies on the site. <br />
          <br />
          To conclude our discussion on how this website showcases user
          interface (UI) and user experience (UX) and ethics. It is clear to see
          that the website showcases a positive well designed user-friendly
          experience while upholding ethical standards. Overall, it is clear to
          see how ‘Daily Sun’ functions as a great example of how interaction
          design can prioritise ethical considerations and offer a positive user
          experience.
