        <p>
          I am a full-time professional model for the agency Boss Models JHB.
          I started my modelling career in the year 2022. Ever since I can
          remember, I've been fascinated by the world of fashion and
          modelling. With hard work and determination, I've been fortunate to
          turn my passion into a successful career. As a model, I have had the
          pleasure of working with renowned photographers, designers, and
          brands, and have gained valuable experience in various aspects of
          the modelling industry, including runway shows, editorial shoots,
          and commercial campaigns
        </p>
        <p>
          With modelling aside, I am a full time third year student at the
          University of Witwatersrand majoring in Game Design and Interactive
          Media by sharpening my skills in various aspects of the field. I'm
          constantly learning and pushing the boundaries of my craft, whether
          it's designing captivating game levels, crafting user-friendly
          interfaces, or coding responsive websites. I'm driven by the need to
          create experiences that are not just physically spectacular, but
          also meaningful and engaging. I think that design has the ability to
          alter and improve how people engage.
