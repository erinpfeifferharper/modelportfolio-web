        <h1>wireframes explaination:</h1>
          <p>
          When we look at my new and updated wireframes as portrayed in the images above, I really love how they turned out along with how my current website looks very similar to my latest designs with a few changes made here and there, as you can see my website is not identical to my wireframe. In this I have decided to discuss each section and any major changes I made.
          </br><br>Home page: from the initially page I removed the ‘Harper’ text displayed and implemented a moving text that displays who I am which you can see as it changes. In conjunction I utilised only one font there instead of two as I felt more drawn to the ‘Lara’ font and felt that the ‘Brown Sugar’ was overbearing and did not bring out my minimalism website idea the way I wanted it to. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>About page: This page came out exactly how I wanted it, although I made a few changes with the placement of my first names and surname. The only thing added to this was a scroll up feature for when the user would like to go to the top but doesn’t need to scroll.  </p>
          <br>
          <p>Portfolio page: For this section, it mainly relied on the images I intended to use for it, these images being my model images from when I work with makeup artist, designers etc. So with this there are three various sections being editorial, beauty and studio. Each page opens into a new page displaying the images related to the portfolio. I made sure that these images were less than 1MB so that they can load in time and the user does not struggle waiting for the images because of their size. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Contact page: I really struggled trying to centre the send message text on the button especially when the screen has been made responsive for the various devices along with trying to centre my icons and text for the responsive pages. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Dev Blog page: For the devblogs I made a normal page section wherein you can select which devblog you would like to go into, instead of having all of them displayed on one page which forces the reader to go through them all instead of picking which one they would like to see. This page also made use of a scroll up feature for when the user would like to go to the top but doesn’t need to scroll and is available for each devblog.  </p>
          <br>
          <p>Essay Page: This page has been structure in the same way the devblog page has, however the only difference here is that the essays are two whereas the devblogs are thirteen. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Design Page: For this page I kept it simple as you can see in the wireframe images, however adding my previous design notes along with my new notes and some images if needed to display these notes.</p>
        <h1>implemenation:</h1>
          <p>The implementation of the various designs was very time consuming and quite a difficult process, as one needed to be sure that these various designs were working. Look at the wireframe explanation section to see how these designs were implemented along with more information on them. </p>
        <h1>style guide:</h1>
          <p>Aesthetic: For this I wanted to keep it very minimal and simple. I did not want to do too much as that can overpower the website and make it much difficult for the viewer to engage along with feeling drawn to the website.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Font: The fonts I used was only one which is ‘Lara’ as I decided that there was not much more of a function for the previous second font ‘Brown Sugar’ as I changed the home page of my website to accommodate the new JS element implemented, while trying to stick to the minimal idea.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Colour Scheme: The colour scheme I decide to use for my website were white and the various shades of black and grey. </p>
        <h1>documentation of ixd:</h1>
          <p>Goal Alignment: The goal of my website is to create a website portfolio for my modelling work that showcases various kinds of work I’ve done which will help me receive more possible opportunities to work with other photographers, makeup artists, designers, models, etc. With this I would also like to expand on my website by including more work I’ve done which such as runway (as I could not include it as I have only walked for three designers) I wanted people to feel free to reach out to me so that we are able to collaborate and create content, therefore growing both our portfolios whether they are a photographer or makeup artist, etc.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Interface elements: My website can be seen to make use of the following interface elements, the first one being the navigation bar, which on the home page appear on top of the screen, however when the screen is responsive it will appear as a collapsed nav bar depending on the size of the screen. Furthermore, the use of a scroll up button has been implemented so that when the user is scrolling down the page and they want to go back to the top, it will be done for them smoothly. </p>
        <h1>how does ui and ux impact your code:</h1>
          <p>When it comes to the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), the design of your website can impact your code structure and organisation. Hence why it is important to create folders that reflect the hierarchical information to establish a clear understanding of your code and what each part functions. Hence why I created a new website, using the same HTML, CSS and JS from the previous assignments and made a few changes where needed, especially by removing unnecessary code or stuff that does not align or make sense. </p>
          <br>
          <p>I decided to leave the main pages of the website outside folders and any subpages or styling element into folders to make the information look clear and understandable. With this mentioned it need to separate HTML, JS, and CSS on a logical sense. This was established through in the beginning of the paragraph. This separation improves code structure, maintenance, and reuse. HTML files, for example, should largely contain the structure and content of web pages. Another thing to note is that removing most of the JS I had in my previous websites HTML code is essential so that the person accessing my code can check my JS out along with having my website show that it does contain JS</p>
          <br>
          <p>Naming conventions are essential for attaining modularity and scalability. For having the correct conventions allow the code to be easily read and seen to match the content that the code is functioning to display.</p>
          <br>
          <p>When it comes to the semantic markup of my website, this is seen as one thing that caused possible struggle as the constant use of <div> and <br> tags however after going back countless times and trying to fix it, I am able to see the clear purpose of these tags which is to helps express the meaning and organization of the information through accurately marking up headers, paragraphs, lists, and other components, making it easier for them to read and provide the text to users. From this I feel that my use of semantic tags is on a 50/50 scale, as I have tried to get rid of most, however only some remain. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Moving on to the interface elements of my website, I feel they have been expressed fully and correctly, as an example of one of the tags being the <img> tag, I have made sure to provide an alternative text to my images which assures assistive technology correctly understand interface components, improving accessibility. The same applies to the way I feel about my content being expresses that not only aids browsers and assistive technology in accurately interpreting the material, but also enhances SEO which is Search Engine Optimization. This improves the readability and comprehension of the material for consumers.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Next, we have the JavaScript Section of UX and UI design. In relation to interaction points and functionality, JavaScript is frequently used to represent this which is seen through the event handling and DOM manipulation which I feel has been expressed. An example of where this has been expressed if we look at my code is in the main JS for my website which is the homepage. Given that one would need to express these interaction points and functionality, are they repeated and if so, are they able to be separated out and consolidated. And the answer to this question is yes, for when we look at the JS used for the essay section along with the devblog section, the code is essentially the same hover with a few minor tweaks here and there, as the sections are similar but different at the same time.</p>
          <br>
          <p>To follow is if JS has been avoided in in-line scripting, wherein the answer to this is yes and no for when we look at my previous website for the previous assignment it contained most of the functioning JS elements in the HTML section, which is why in this new HTML file of my website, I ensured that I placed them in the related folders, with the only thing being the navigation JS in the HTML part instead of all of them which in itself is still not good but better than before. </p>
          <br>
          <p>The last part of how UI and UX impact your code that we will be looking at is using CSS elements. With this section everything has been strictly done on the CSS style sheet, which I wish was the case with my JS and everything in my style sheet has been labelled accordingly so that they are easy to understand and see what section is for what and how have they been used. An important factor of CSS is to create adaptable layouts that adjust to different screen sizes and devices to provide a consistent and ideal user experience across several platforms such as computers, tablets, and smartphones. This is seen through the wireframes created for the various devices along with the actual responsiveness of the website. </p>
